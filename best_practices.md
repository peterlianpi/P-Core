# ðŸ“˜ Project Best Practices

## 1. Project Purpose
Pâ€‘Core is a multi-tenant platform built with Next.js (App Router), React, Hono (for API routing), and Prisma (PostgreSQL) that provides featureâ€‘based modules such as student management, course scheduling, attendance tracking, library and church management, feedback collection, and version/release management. Security is enforced endâ€‘toâ€‘end using NextAuth (Edge+Node split), organization role/permission checks, and databaseâ€‘level Rowâ€‘Level Security (RLS).

## 2. Project Structure
- Featureâ€‘based organization. Keep UI, API, validation, and domain logic coâ€‘located by feature.
- Key directories and roles:
  - app/: Next.js App Router pages/layouts and API entry (Hono under app/api/[[...route]]). Global styles in app/globals.css.
  - app/api/[[...route]]/: Hono router entry (route.ts) and domain route modules (e.g., version.ts, org.ts, feedback.ts, dashboard.ts, superadmin.ts). Public routes registered before the organization security middleware; protected routes after it.
  - components/: Reusable UI, Tailwind/ShadCN based components (including ui/, adminâ€‘components/, etc.).
  - features/: Feature modules grouped by domain (system/, schoolâ€‘management/, organizationâ€‘management/, dashboard/). Each feature may include components/, api/, lib/, types/ as needed.
  - lib/: Core libraries (auth, db, security/tenant, utils, schemas, mail, telegram, org services). Centralized error handling (lib/utils/apiâ€‘errors.ts), RLS helpers (lib/db/rls.sql), security middleware (lib/security/tenant.ts).
  - prisma/: Prisma schema and migrations. Multiâ€‘schema strategy (auth, domain) with orgId scoping.
  - hooks/: Custom React hooks (auth/session, role, device, store, upload, etc.).
  - providers/: React context providers.
  - config/: Build/configuration (e.g., prisma.ts).
  - docs/: Authoritative documentation (architecture, security, RLS, features, reviews, development guides, folder structure, changelogs).
  - tests/: Vitest configuration and tests (unit/integration, setup mocks, some e2e scaffolding).
  - scripts/: Utility scripts (performance monitoring, setup, etc.).
- Entry points:
  - API: app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts (Hono app + global middleware + public/protected routes).
  - Auth guard: middleware.ts (Edge runtime auth for route access control).
  - Prisma: prisma/schema.prisma and lib/db/client singleton.

## 3. Test Strategy
- Frameworks: Vitest + React Testing Library; Playwright available for e2e.
- Setup:
  - tests/setup.ts configures jsdom, adds RTL matchers, mocks browser APIs, Next.js modules (next/navigation, next/image, next/link), nextâ€‘auth/react, and Prisma clients used in tests.
  - vitest.config.ts uses environment: jsdom, global test patterns, coverage (v8) with 70% baseline thresholds and path alias @ -> project root.
- Organization:
  - tests/<domain or area>/*.test.(ts|tsx) for unit/integration tests.
  - Use tests/setup.ts for shared mocks. Prefer unit tests for utilities/services and integration tests for Hono endpoints and auth/permission flows.
- Mocking Guidelines:
  - Mock nextâ€‘auth/react session for authenticated paths.
  - Mock Prisma for unit tests; prefer exercising real validation + Hono route composition in integration tests.
  - Mock browser APIs (IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver) as provided in setup.
- Philosophy:
  - Unit tests for pure logic (utils, services, validators).
  - Integration tests for API routes (Hono groups, middleware, permission checks, org context/RLS scoping).
  - Limited e2e for critical user journeys.

## 4. Code Style
- Language/Typing:
  - TypeScript everywhere. Exported APIs should be typed. Prefer explicit return types on exported functions.
  - Use zod for validation; coâ€‘locate schemas with the feature or place shared ones under lib/schemas.
- React/Next:
  - Coâ€‘locate feature components and hooks under features/<feature>.
  - Keep components focused on presentation; move data access and heavy logic into lib/services or API routes/server actions.
  - Use TanStack Query for server state and reactâ€‘hookâ€‘form + @hookform/resolvers/zod for forms.
- Naming:
  - Components: PascalCase; hooks: useThing; files/folders: kebabâ€‘case (or lowerâ€‘camel consistently as already used), barrel index.ts for exports where helpful.
  - API routes grouped by domain file names (e.g., version.ts, org.ts) under app/api/[[...route]].
- Documentation/Comments:
  - Add concise comments for public APIs, complex logic, and all securityâ€‘sensitive code.
  - Update /docs whenever behaviors or architecture change (see docs/PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md).
- Error handling:
  - For Hono routes, throw errors or use ApiError; rely on app.onError + handleApiError in lib/utils/apiâ€‘errors.ts for consistent responses (Zod, Prisma known errors, prod/dev behavior).
  - For server actions, use handleError from lib/utils/apiâ€‘errors.ts.
- Async/Performance:
  - Prefer async/await, handle rejections. Use Prisma select/include, indexes, and pagination. Memoize where appropriate.

## 5. Common Patterns
- Hono API Composition:
  - Global middleware: logger, secureHeaders, CORS, timeout, then centralized onError.
  - Public routes are registered before organizationSecurityMiddleware; Protected routes are registered after `.use(organizationSecurityMiddleware)`.
  - Use zod and @hono/zodâ€‘validator for input validation.
- Multiâ€‘Tenancy & Security:
  - organizationSecurityMiddleware validates access, sets RLS context via set_org_context, attaches orgContext to Hono Context.
  - Use getOrganizationContext(c), requirePermission("action:resource"), requireRole("ROLE"), and requireSuperadmin() where applicable.
  - Database RLS policies in lib/db/rls.sql; every domain table includes org_id and enforces tenant isolation.
- Authentication:
  - Edge: lib/auth/auth.edge.ts for middleware.ts; Node: lib/auth/auth.ts for server code (ensures Prisma stays out of Edge bundles).
  - Public/auth routes configured in lib/auth/routes.ts; middleware.ts handles redirects and guards.
- UI/Styling:
  - Tailwind CSS with design tokens in globals.css; ShadCN UI (Radix primitives) for accessible components. Compose via utility classes; prefer reusable components in components/ui/.
- Utilities:
  - Centralized errors (lib/utils/apiâ€‘errors.ts), tokens, org services, mail, logging, theme system.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts
- Do
  - Group by feature; coâ€‘locate UI, API, validation, and domain logic.
  - Protect all domain API routes with organizationSecurityMiddleware, then use requirePermission/requireRole for fineâ€‘grained checks.
  - Validate all inputs with zod; return consistent error JSON via handleApiError.
  - Keep Prisma out of Edge runtime (do not import Prisma in middleware or edge code).
  - Use environment variables for secrets; never hardcode secrets or tokens.
  - Write tests for critical flows (auth, permissions, CRUD) and keep coverage â‰¥ thresholds.
  - Use Tailwind utility classes + ShadCN components; maintain a11y and consistent theming.
  - Add comments to clarify intent, security assumptions, and nonâ€‘obvious logic.
- Don't
  - Donâ€™t bypass RLS or forget to set org context in protected API routes.
  - Donâ€™t put heavy logic directly in React components.
  - Donâ€™t leak stack traces or PII in production responses/logs.
  - Donâ€™t commit .env or secrets to VCS.
  - Donâ€™t create typeâ€‘less or unvalidated API endpoints.

## 7. Tools & Dependencies
- Key Libraries
  - Runtime/UI: next, react, reactâ€‘dom, nextâ€‘themes, lucideâ€‘react, framerâ€‘motion.
  - API: hono, @hono/zodâ€‘validator.
  - Auth: nextâ€‘auth, @auth/prismaâ€‘adapter.
  - Data: @prisma/client, prisma.
  - Forms/Data Fetching: reactâ€‘hookâ€‘form, @hookform/resolvers, zod, @tanstack/reactâ€‘query.
  - Styling: tailwindcss, tailwindcssâ€‘animate, classâ€‘varianceâ€‘authority, clsx, shadcn (via components), radixâ€‘ui.
  - Misc: nodemailer/resend (mail), cloudinary (images), dateâ€‘fns.
- Dev & QA
  - Vitest (+ @vitest/ui, @testingâ€‘library/*, jsdom), Playwright, ESLint (+ Next/Tailwind plugins), Prettier (+ tailwind plugin), Husky + lintâ€‘staged.
- Scripts (package.json)
  - dev/build/start via Bun; typeâ€‘check, lint, format; prisma db:*; test, test:watch, test:coverage; performance scripts; prepare (husky install).
- Setup Instructions
  1) bun install
  2) Copy .env and set required vars (DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, SMTP/Resend, Cloudinary, Telegram, etc.). See docs/ and package.json.
  3) bun run db:generate && bun run db:migrate (or db:push for prototyping)
  4) (Optional) Apply RLS policies: bun run db:rls (ensure DATABASE_URL points to your DB)
  5) bun run dev
  6) bunx vitest run (or bunx vitest watch) for tests; ensure tests/setup.ts is used by vitest.config.ts

## 8. Other Notes
- When generating new code:
  - Follow featureâ€‘based structure (features/<feature>/{components,api,lib,types}).
  - For APIs, integrate with Hono under app/api/[[...route]] and register routes in the appropriate public/protected section. Validate with zod; use handleApiError.
  - Enforce org security using organizationSecurityMiddleware and permission/role checks. Never import Prisma into Edge runtime.
  - Use Tailwind + ShadCN patterns; ensure accessibility and consistent theming.
  - Reuse utilities from lib/ (tokens, utils, services) and types from Prisma when applicable.
- Roles & Permissions:
  - Core roles include SUPERADMIN, OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, MEMBER, ACCOUNTANT, OFFICE_STAFF (see lib/security/tenant.ts). Map teacher/student semantics to existing roles (e.g., Teacher -> MANAGER/ADMIN; Student -> MEMBER). Extend ROLE_PERMISSIONS when adding new capabilities.
- Domain Focus:
  - Student management, course scheduling, attendance, versions, feedback, library & church modules. All domain models include orgId and are RLSâ€‘guarded.
- CI/CD & Ops:
  - Recommended pipeline: install â†’ typeâ€‘check â†’ lint â†’ test â†’ build â†’ deploy. Cache node_modules and .next. Use Vercel or compatible infra. Document workflows in /docs; keep CHANGELOGs updated.
- Documentation:
  - Keep docs/ authoritative (architecture, RLS, security updates, feature guides). Update docs when adding or modifying features, and include migration notes for schema or API changes.
