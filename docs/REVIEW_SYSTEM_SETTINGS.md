# System Settings Page Review

## 1. app/(protected)/settings/page.tsx
- Fetches current user and Telegram settings asynchronously.
- Uses useOrgData hook for organizations.
- Normalizes Telegram settings before passing to UserSettingsForm.
- Returns null if no user found (could improve with loading state).
- Acts as a container component passing data to UserSettingsForm.

## 2. features/system/settings/user-settings-form.tsx
- Client component rendering a DynamicForm with user settings schema and fields.
- Dynamically populates organization options for defaultOrgId field.
- Normalizes Telegram settings for form default values.
- Handles form submission by filtering out empty fields and calling settings action.
- Uses toast notifications for success and error feedback.
- Calls useSession update to refresh session after successful update.

## 3. actions/settings/settings.ts
- Server action handling user settings update.
- Validates current user and authorization.
- Handles email change with uniqueness check and verification email.
- Handles password change with bcrypt verification and hashing.
- Handles image upload with error handling.
- Updates or creates Telegram settings with scope based on user role.
- Updates user record in database with new values.
- Tracks two-factor authentication enable/disable events.
- Returns success or error messages accordingly.

## 4. components/ui/dialog.tsx
- Not currently used in the reviewed settings page or form.
- Could be used for future modal dialogs or confirmations.

## Suggestions and Improvements
- Add loading or fallback UI in app/(protected)/settings/page.tsx when user data is loading.
- Add error handling UI if fetching user or Telegram settings fails.
- Consider adding confirmation dialogs for sensitive changes (email, password) using components/ui/dialog.tsx.
- Add unit and integration tests for settings update logic and form validation.
- Document the settings update flow and API in project documentation.

## Testing Recommendations
- Test user settings update with valid and invalid data.
- Test email change flow including verification email sending.
- Test password change with correct and incorrect current password.
- Test image upload error handling.
- Test Telegram settings update and creation.
- Test two-factor authentication enable/disable tracking.
