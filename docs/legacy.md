# Legacy Engineering Instructions for P-Core

This document archives the original set of standards and practices for the P-Core project. These instructions formed the foundation for our current engineering guidelines and remain available for historical reference.

## Original Standards

- Always write clean, modular code using Next.js, React, Prisma, and Hono.
- Prefer feature-based folder structures for organizing projects.
- When asked to generate code, prioritize performance, readability, and reuse.
- Always add comments in code snippets unless instructed not to.
- Prefer Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI for styling frontend components.
- Explain code in a learning-friendly way if the user asks for understanding.
- Refer to official documentation when uncertain or for clarification links.
- If incomplete context is provided, ask a follow-up question before generating.
